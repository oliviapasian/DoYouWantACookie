                    <p>Part of the fear and concern surrounding cookies and browsing privacy is that they are not widely understood.

                <p>As shown previously, you can specifically check on cookies in your browser, but privacy policies are the best way to get a sense of what a website may be doing with your data and information. </p>

The results were that nearly <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/" target="_blank">6 in 10</a> Americans frequently skip reading privacy policies.                    </p>
